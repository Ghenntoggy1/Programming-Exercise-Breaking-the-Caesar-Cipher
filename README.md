PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Breaking the Caesar Cipher"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Assignment 1: Word lengths
                    task 1 - find the lengths of all words in a file
                    (exclude punctuation from beggining and end of the word)
                    task 2 - figure out the most common word length of 
                    words from a file.
                    Assignment 2: Caesar Cipher One Key and Two Keys Decrypt
                    task 1 - decrypt message that was encrypted with one
                    key using Caesar Cipher;
                    task 2 - decrypt message that was encrypted with two
                    keys using Caesar Cipher (every character on odd index
                    was encrypted using key 1 and every character on even 
                    index was encrypted using key 2);

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named 
                           "package.bluej". Find inside of this project 3 
                           classes: WordLengths - compile, create object of 
                           type WordLengths and start the function: 
                           "testCountWordLengths" for task 1 and 2; 
                           CaesarCipher (used for assignment 2) - compile, 
                           create object of type CaesarCipher and start one 
                           of the following functions: 
                           "testCaesar" for encryption using one key; 
                           "testTwoKeys" for encryption using two keys; 
                           and CaesarBreaker (assignment 2) - compile, 
                           create object of type CaesarCipher and start one 
                           of the following functions: 
                           "testDecryptOneKey" for task 1; 
                           "testDecryptTwoKeys" for task 2;
                           You will be required to choose one txt file for 
                           decryption. You may choose from available in 
                           example files.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: you will need library: "edu.duke.FileResource" 
                   (simplified version of File function from Java)
